# Emotion-Analysis-LSTM
An LSTM-based model designed for emotion analysis of text. Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the model processes and classifies text data into various emotion categories.

# Dataset
The dataset[^1] is a collection of documents and its emotions, It helps greatly in NLP Classification tasks. List of documents with emotion flag, Dataset is split into train, test & validation for building the machine learning model. It contains the emotions (sadness, anger, joy, fear, surprise).

# Aim

The aim of an LSTM-based emotion analysis application is to automatically detect and classify emotions expressed in text data. Here are some key objectives and benefits of such an application:

  1. Emotion Detection: The primary goal is to identify and categorize emotions (such as joy, sadness, anger, etc.) from text. This can be useful in understanding the sentiment or emotional tone of user-generated content.
  
  2. Enhanced User Experience: By understanding user emotions, applications can tailor responses, provide better customer support, or offer personalized recommendations based on emotional context.
  
  3. Content Analysis: It helps in analyzing large volumes of text data, such as social media posts, reviews, or feedback, to gauge public sentiment or monitor brand perception.
  
  4. Mental Health Monitoring: Emotion analysis can be used to detect signs of mental health issues or distress in users' text, potentially providing valuable insights for mental health professionals.
  
  5. Improved Communication: In applications like chatbots or virtual assistants, recognizing and responding appropriately to emotions can make interactions more natural and empathetic.
  
  6. Market Research: Businesses can use emotion analysis to understand consumer feelings towards products, services, or marketing campaigns, helping in decision-making and strategy development.
